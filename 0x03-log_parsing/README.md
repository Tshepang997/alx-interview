For the “0x03. Log Parsing” project, you will need to apply your knowledge of Python programming, focusing on parsing and processing data streams in real-time. This project involves reading from standard input (stdin), handling data in a specific format, and performing calculations based on the input data. Here’s a list of concepts and resources that you might find useful:

Concepts Needed: File I/O in Python:

Understand how to read from sys.stdin line by line. Python Input and Output Signal Handling in Python:

Handling keyboard interruption (CTRL + C) using signal handling in Python. Python Signal Handling Data Processing:

Parsing strings to extract specific data points. Aggregating data to compute summaries. Regular Expressions:

Using regular expressions to validate the format of each line. Python Regular Expressions Dictionaries in Python:
